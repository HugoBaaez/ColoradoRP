The first Spooni House package is finally ready.

How is it installed?

Copy spooni_houses into the resources folder. 

Then in the server.cfg
write

ensure spooni_houses

Copy the objects.lua file to the Spooner folder

resources/spooner/data/rdr3/ there.

feel free to overwrite the file, all Spooner objects are in the list.

then restart server. 

Start Spooner under Objects, the list of Spooni Houses and Props is now at the top. 

It is important that all objects are in it, but of course only those that you have purchased will work.

-------------How the Houses Works-------------------------
The houses are rainproof with the stop-rainfall. 
Place the house wherever you want than,
place the stop-rainfall exactly on the same coordinates.
export it as ymap. 
You can save everything you place in the house in the same ymap file.
----------------------------------------------------------
have fun.
